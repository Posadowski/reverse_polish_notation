# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

This is a simple program written in C that converts algebraic expressions into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and then evaluates their value.

## Getting Started

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reverse_polish_notation.git
   ```

2. Compile the C code using the provided Makefile:

   ```sh
   cd reverse_polish_notation
   make
   ```

3. This will create an executable file named `reverse_polish_notation.exe`.

## Usage

Once the program is compiled, you can run it from the command line. The program will prompt you to enter an algebraic expression, which it will then convert to RPN and calculate its value.

Here's an example of how to run the program:

```sh
./reverse_polish_notation.exe
Enter an algebraic expression: 3 + 4 * (2 - 1)
Result: 7.0
```

## Supported Operators

The program supports the following operators:
- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Parentheses `(` and `)`
